# Python GOAT\n\nPython GOAT is an application designed with Flask and MongoDB running in Docker. It\'s a powerful and flexible tool that can be customized to fit your requirements.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nThese instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nBefore you can run the project, you'll need to have the following software installed:\n\n- Docker: Please see the [Docker installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)\n- Docker Compose: Please see the [Docker Compose installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)\n\n### Installation\n\n1. Clone this repository to your local machine:\n\n\`\`\`bash\ngit clone https://github.com/yourusername/Python-GOAT.git\n\`\`\`\n\n2. Navigate to the project's root directory:\n\n\`\`\`bash\ncd Python-GOAT\n\`\`\`\n\n3. Run Docker Compose to start MongoDB:\n\n\`\`\`bash\ndocker-compose up\n\`\`\`\n\nThis command starts MongoDB within a Docker container. Docker Compose will automatically pull the MongoDB image if it's not already present on your machine.\n\n### Running the Application\n\nOnce MongoDB is running, you can start the Flask application with the following command from the root directory:\n\n\`\`\`bash\npython app.py\n\`\`\`\n\nEnsure that you're using the correct version of Python (Python 3) and that all necessary dependencies are installed.\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe love to receive contributions from the community.
